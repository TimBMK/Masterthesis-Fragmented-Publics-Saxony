# Masterthesis-Fragmented-Publics-Saxony
R Code for my Master Thesis in Social Sciences at the Humdoldt University Berlin on the Fragmentation of Twitter Publics surrounding the state elections in Saxony in 2019

The Thesis had a strong focus on political theory, especially public sphere theory, and the application of the term 'fragmentation' to public spheres on Twitter. In order to demonstrate the importance of substantially defining the concepts measured, an analysis of Twitter data on the state elections in the German state of Saxony in 2019 was conducted. These include a network analysis and a structural topic modeling. Visualizations of the network were done with Gephi and the circlize package for R.

The code for the analyses can be found in this repository. While the complete data is not provided, the data collection process and the relevant results are included for reproducability.
